#R2 Archive View

This tool allows users to view the body of an R2 historical article that has been migrated into composer / flexible.

Since Composer is more strict about HTML than R2, some historic articles had to have their HTML partially stripped as part of the migration process.

This tool allows you to view the HTML "pre-stripping" for cases when discrepancies arise.
